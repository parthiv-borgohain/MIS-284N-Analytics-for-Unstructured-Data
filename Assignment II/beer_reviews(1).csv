8,"Stouts, especially Imperial Stouts, are my favorite style, so I try them whenever I can. Even though Bourbon County changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!', '\nEvery year, my friends and I buy up as much as we can get our hands on.

I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.

Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.', '\nA: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5', '\nS: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5', '\nT: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5', '\nM: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5', '\nD: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening.

Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans.

A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer.

201,"""Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father.

Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor.

A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity.

I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it.

I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.', '\n', '\nAs with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.', '\n', '\nBody leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker.

In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions', '\n', '\nM: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness.

In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques', '\n', '\nO: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods.

"", '\n', ""\nPours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen. "", '\n', ""\nNose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. "", '\n', ""\nPalate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. "", '\n', ""\nMouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. "", '\n', '\nOverall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.",Montmorency Vs Balaton ,4.44,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25

Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above', '\n', '\nS: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length', '\n', '\nT: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin ', '\n', '\nM: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms ', '\n', '\nO: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks.

Sampled on 05/15/22', '\n$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22', '\n', '\nNotes via stream of consciousness: It\'s poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger\'s width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It\'s bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it\'s way through all of the sweet malt (it\'s got to be more bitter but you just can\'t tell) but there\'s also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it\'s medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother.

In the mouth it\'s medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It\'s smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge.

The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It\'s poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger\'s width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn\'t happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It\'s sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It\'s threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There\'s some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It\'s got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it\'s medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can\'t say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more.

It\'s poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger\'s width of creamy white foam. The aroma expresses passionfruit, soft orange, nectarine, and hop resins. Tasting it reveals a sweetish, basic malt that\'s bready and must be made up of of 2-row brewers malt as well as wheat and oats although I can\'t taste the oats specifically. I\'m finding passionfruit, pineapple, peach, orange, and lemon/lime as well as more hop resin. There\'s a lot of hop bite to it, and a decent amout of bitterness although there\'s also a lot of malt to balance it. Things are becoming clearer to me now - this is a double IPA, and not just a more heavily hopped version of ""Green"". I actually like it better. The additional maltiness softens it and allows the hop flavors to come through more clearly. It seems less bitter, although it\'s probably got more IBUs. Beyond that, the hop bite is smoothed out. There\'s additional alcohol but it doesn\'t stick out any more than you want it to in a double IPA. It\'s dry in the finish but not as dry as the original, and it\'s certainly not as seemingly bitter and biting overall. I find it very rounded and smooth, while at the same time still a bit of a hulk of a beer. I\'m about halfway through so let me comment on the head retention and lacing, and then the mouthfeel. The head has held up really well and I still have a creamy surface covering. The lacing covers the glass with swirling \'stained glass\' and sweeping waves breaking into spots of sea foam.

I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV.

Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at.

Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish.

1778,"""Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.""",Leche Borracho ,4.9,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.75,4.75

Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength.
